## Problem that caused this project

Team `[backend]` every time they start project and collect data with `DynamoDB` they have a page that has a `collection functions to do someting with DynamoDB` But when doing this in many projects , and functions is is edited , it must be followed up and edited in every project for `[backend]` , causing difficulty and the information is not consistent

Advantages :

- It would be very helpful if we could make the `backend function` we use more flexible. It becomes a `npm package` that can be downloaded from the same place

- Because if corrections occur, they will be able Can be `edited in one spot`

<br>

## About the project

Building and publishing backend function to `Node Package Manager(NPM)` easy to share and reuse code useful in projects , this article will guide you through the steps of building and `publishing` NPM package.

<br>

## Prerequisites

- [NPM account](https://www.npmjs.com)
- Docker
- NodeJS
- GitHub for clone , push and others
- Basic understanding of JavaScript / TypeScript

<br>

## Project structure

```sh
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ dist                          # compiled folder for `publish` to npm
    â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules                  # package to use in project
    â”œâ”€â”€ src                           # important folder
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components                # components folder for usage
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dynamoDB.ts           # collect function to call DynamoDB
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts              # file to import all function and export
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ other.ts              # collect function basic
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx                 # calling function to test
    â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml            # docker compose file to start project
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json                  # package.json to script command
    â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json                 # tsconfig.json to setting script command
    â””â”€â”€
```

<br>

## ðŸ“¢ Getting started - `Building & Publishing` NPM Package

1.) Clone the repo

```sh
git clone _ _ _
```

2.) Open 2 terminals

- 2.1 ) Terminal 1 : keep running `npm run dev`

```sh
$ docker compose up
```

- 2.2 ) Terminal 2 : bash in to `npm-be` container for use npm & script command

```sh
$ sudo docker exec -it npm-be bash
```

3.) Register new function and Implements at

```sh
  .
  â”œâ”€â”€ dynamoDB.ts                     # collect function to call DynamoDB
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts                        # file to import all function and export
  â”œâ”€â”€ other.ts                        # collect function basic
  â””â”€â”€
```

4.) Use command to create compiled folder `dist` to publish to `NPM`

```sh
npm run build
```

5.) Before publish to `NPM` you need to login in command

- Login into Gmail waiting to receive 6 digit code
- Promp command below `npm login` . . . it will return url to replace digit code
- Open Gmail copy _digit code_ and replace in website
- And press enter , command will say ( Logged in âœ” )
